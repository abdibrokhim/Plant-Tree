## Transforming Screen Time into Green Time (or just don't `[touch grass](https://x.com/RhysKentish/status/1900327667364487417)` but make something impactful)

In an era where youth spends an average of 6.6 hours daily consuming media content, much of it lost to endless doomscrolling, _.env_ offers a revolutionary alternative. Our app gamifies eco-friendly activities—like planting trees, conserving water, and recycling—turning habitual screen engagement into tangible environmental impact. By redirecting just 30 minutes of daily doomscrolling towards _.env_, users can plant approximately 30 trees annually, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet. Join us in transforming idle scrolling into meaningful action for a sustainable future.

## How 30 trees annually?

1. **Time Spent Doomscrolling**: Studies have indicated that individuals, particularly in younger demographics, spend a significant amount of time on their devices engaging in activities like doomscrolling.

2. **Time Required to Plant a Tree**: The duration needed to plant a tree varies depending on factors such as tree size and planting method. For instance:
   - **Saplings**: Planting a sapling can take approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
   - **Container-Grown or Burlap-Wrapped Trees**: These may require about an hour to plant. 

3. **Assumptions for the Calculation**:
   - **Daily Time Allocation**: Redirecting 30 minutes daily from doomscrolling to eco-friendly activities.
   - **Activity Breakdown**: Assuming that not all 30 minutes are solely dedicated to planting; time is also spent on related eco-activities such as watering, waste separation, or community engagement within the app.
   - **Tree Planting Frequency**: If planting a sapling takes about 30 minutes, dedicating one day per month to planting (utilizing the accumulated 30 minutes daily over a month) would result in planting one tree per month. Over a year, this totals approximately 12 trees.
   - **Enhanced Engagement**: The gamified nature of the app may motivate users to participate in additional eco-friendly activities, potentially increasing the number of trees planted or other environmental benefits achieved.
